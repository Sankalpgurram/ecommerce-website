The plant's name,  'Monstera,' derives from the Latin word for 'monstrous,' referring to its impressive size, while    'Deliciosa' hints at its edible fruit, which tastes like a mix of pineapple and banana but is rarely  produced indoors.<br><br>Care Requirements: <br> <ul><li> Light: Thrives in bright, indirect light but tolerates low light (though growth may slow).</li><li> Water: Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry; avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li> <li> Soil: Prefers well-draining, peat-based potting mix. </li> <li> Humidity: Loves high humidity (50%+), but adapts to average household levels.</li> <li> Temperature: Best between 65-85째F (18-29째C); avoid cold drafts.</li><li> Support: As a climber, it benefits from a moss pole or trellis for vertical growth.</li></ul>",
