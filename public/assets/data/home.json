              "info": " The Monstera Deliciosa, commonly known as the Swiss Cheese Plant, is a popular tropical houseplant    prized for its stunning, large, heart-shaped leaves that develop unique perforations or 'fenestrations' as they mature. Native to the rainforests of Central and South America, this evergreen climber can grow  up to 10-15 feet indoors with proper care, though it's often kept smaller in pots. Its glossy, dark green leaves, which can reach up to 3 feet wide in ideal conditions, create a bold, exotic aesthetic, making it a favorite for interior decor and web design visuals. The plant's name,  'Monstera,' derives from the Latin word for 'monstrous,' referring to its impressive size, while    'Deliciosa' hints at its edible fruit, which tastes like a mix of pineapple and banana but is rarely  produced indoors.<br><br>Care Requirements: <br> <ul><li> Light: Thrives in bright, indirect light but tolerates low light (though growth may slow).</li><li> Water: Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry; avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li> <li> Soil: Prefers well-draining, peat-based potting mix. </li> <li> Humidity: Loves high humidity (50%+), but adapts to average household levels.</li> <li> Temperature: Best between 65-85°F (18-29°C); avoid cold drafts.</li><li> Support: As a climber, it benefits from a moss pole or trellis for vertical growth.</li></ul>",
